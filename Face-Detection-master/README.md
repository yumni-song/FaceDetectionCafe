# Face-Detection

## Project Description:

face detector based on OpenCV and deep learning using opencv's Caffe model. This face detector is based on (SSD) the Single Shot Detector framework with a backbone of ResNet base network.


### Prototxt and Caffemodel files usage
- The .prototxt file that defines the model architecture.
- The .caffemodel file that contains the weights for the actual layers.
